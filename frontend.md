# Frontend

Frontend is the part of an application that shows the user what to see on the screen. Frontend technology can be divided into multiple parts, such as **mobile apps** and **web apps**. In web applications, the most commonly used technologies are **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Purpose of Frontend

Frontend is responsible for:

- **User Interface (UI)** → what the user sees  
- **User Experience (UX)** → how the user interacts with the app  
- **Interactivity and styling** → making the app functional and visually appealing  
- **Responsiveness** → ensuring the app works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens  

## Example

When we open websites like **Facebook** or **Twitter**, we see:

- Navbar  
- Buttons  
- Forms  
- Other interactive elements  

All of these are part of **frontend technologies**.

## Web Technologies

For websites, the most commonly used technologies are:

- **HTML** → Structure of the page  
- **CSS** → Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** → Interactivity and behavior
